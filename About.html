<h3 class="topics">Projects</h3>
<p><b class="content">So when coming to talk about our projects, 95% of the work is done by Senu Gamer Boy. Why did I mentioned it as 95%? Because, he is the one who create bot repositories. And about other 5%, it's me who designs about texts and descriptions. But the creator of this website is Induwara Edirisooriya. One reason why only Senu Gamer Boy creates these repositories is that he is the only one in our organization who knows about the languages that is used create them. For example "Python". I guess that makes sence. So if you're totally fine with this explanation, let's move on to the next topic.</b></p>
